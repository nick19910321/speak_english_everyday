the increase in business activities and cultural exchanges across the world may pave the way for cooperation in different fields since people involved are increasingly culturally competent.

may may pave the way for cooperation cooperation cooperation cooperation work together closely work closely since people involved are increasingly culturally competent they can gain insight into other cultures by communicating with foreigners in other countries, where they conduct business with locals, pursue a degree and visit cultural attractions on vacation. this means that they will gradually understand business practices, ways of life ways of living and values that prevail in other countries. As they are aware of cultural differences, they can speak and behave in the ways that are respectful to each other. they are aware of cultural differences, they can speak and behave in the ways that are respectful to each other. this holds the key to a strong relationship, which enables them to explore business opportunities and achieve prosperity together.
on the other hand, the increased connection in the business world and cultural life may have a detrimental effect on the identities of a country as the young people in less developed parts of the world imitate the conventions of rich nations. They come into contact with the lifestyles and traditions of leading economies, such as the us and britain,by watching films and reading books imported from abroad. they work for multinational companies, they will also be influenced by the rules, practices and traditions introduced by foreign employers, including the ways to reward employees and celebrate foreign festivals. These young people will gradually lose a sense of their own identity when they respect western traditions rather than their own.
In my view, the explosive growth in business activity and cultural exchange can encourage people, especially those in the developing world, to protect their cultural heritage, which is a source of pride. As foreign tourists flock to cultural sites on holiday or show strong interest in traditional art, ethnic cuisines, local handicrafts and heritage buildings, it will reshape local residents' perception of the lifestyles, customs, skills and knowledge they have inherited from previous generations. They would attempt to keep their cultures alive and preserve all traditions, which can help reinforce the sense of identity, despite of the influence of exotic cultures.
In conclusion, I would argue that the stronger business ties and cultural connections between countries can benefit economic progress and cultural protection alike.
